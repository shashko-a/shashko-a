Hi!
I'm Antanina Shashko. I'm early career Analyst / Data Scientist, retrained from plant biology. 
I am working with data, statistics and some neural networks, 
so I want to develop my skills in this direction and to benefit your company

I graduated from Biology faculty of Belarusian State University (master degree) in 2020,
where my major was plant physiology, in particular phenomics (a transdisciplinary 
area of research that involves biology, data sciences, engineering and other fields)

My work experience:
- Business Analyst (Trainee, Intern) at Aspex (https://aspex.kz/ysclid=ldrulij94c93829038), 10.2022 – 12.2022

Functional responsibilities:
• Drawing business processes, writing their regulations
• Preparation of dashboard prototypes and technical specifications for BI specialists
• Client Interviewing
• Projects in the area of production, sales, finance, HR-analytics, etc.

• Work with Belarusian and international standards (GOST, ISO, etc.)


I am familiar with the main tools for data analysis and visualization, 
key metrics (marketing, product, HR-analytics, etc.). 
I have experience of successfully completing an internship in Business Analytics (Aspex, Kazakhstan),
where I mainly worked with business processes, their regulations, prototypes of dashboards 
and technical specifications for BI specialists. 
My previous work experience is directly related to statistical data processing and analysis, 
but in the field of biological experiments; also, I practiced with training some neural networks.

I’m looking for a remote job or internship in the field of Data Analysis or Python Development.
